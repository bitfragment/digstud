# Lateness and absences

* The first half of this course is lecture-based and otherwise very much “online”
* The second half, beginning 10/31, will require committed personal participation in discussion

^ If you’ve gotten accustomed to skipping classes or coming in late...

^ FAIR WARNING: your evaluations in next portion of course will suffer
