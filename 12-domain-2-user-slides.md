# [fit] [How Secure is My Password?](https://howsecureismypassword.net)

^ Let's use resource that will tell us how long it would take to crack different kinds of passwords

^ Open sticky note, type-copy-paste:
  1. password
  2. password123
  3. Ask them for random letters and numbers

^ Have them generate passwords, and test
