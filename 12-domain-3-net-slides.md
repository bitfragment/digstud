# [fit] Relation

^ Regardless of complexity, focus is on relation

^ Not on objects in isolation from one another

----

^ Graph is something like a family, insofar as...

^ Often self, as object, is defined in terms of relation to other

^ Family role only has meaning in relation to other roles

# Network

^ Our contemporary concept of network is extrapolated from the concept of the graph

----

^ Like most graphs of data, a network is theoretically infinite

^ A space defined not by its boundaries, but by relation, connection among elements

# Homer, *Iliad* book 18, ca. 1240-1260 BC

> Like the beacons that one by one flare out at sunset from an island besieged by an enemy, its city cloaked all day by smoke rising to high heaven, for whose safety men fought from the battlements all day in bitter conflict; like those beacons, whose light shines out on high for all their neighbours to see, in hopes they might send their ships to the rescue...

^ Use of smoke and fire signals in preclassical Greece

# Aeschylus, *Agamemnon*, ca. 458 BC

I’m still looking for that signal flare,
the fiery blaze from Troy, announcing
it’s been taken. These are my instructions
from the queen.

^ Opening of play, in Argos

^ Watchman ordered by Clytemnestra to watch for a fire signal sent by her husband Agamemnon to mark the conquest of Troy

^ System of mountaintop beacons

^ The semaphore was replaced by telegraph systems beginning in the 1830s

^ Then telephone systems beginning in the 1870s

^ Followed railroad construction

----

![](http://thebmi.org/wp-content/gallery/archives/telegraph_lines.jpg)

^ Became a feature of streets in major cities (Baltimore)

----

![](http://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large/9-new-york-blizzard-of-1888-granger.jpg)

^ A lot of the cables snapped and pulled down poles with them

^ After that, NYC buried its telecommunications infrastructure underground

----

^ Telegraph cables were eventually run under the Atlantic Ocean too

^ And other major bodies of water

^ A central hub where network operators routed and connected calls to each other

^ After about 15 more years of development, became the Internet as we know it

----

# [fit] How the Internet works

^ Let's talk a little bit about how the Internet actually works, in a technical sense

----

# Three kinds of networks

1. Centralized
2. Decentralized
3. Distributed

^ To understand how Internet works, need to understand differences between three kinds of networks

^ Described by Paul Baran, engineer at RAND in 1960s

----

![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/US_nuclear_strike_map.svg/1280px-US_nuclear_strike_map.svg.png)

^ Context for this was the Cold War

^ Planning for a Soviet nuclear strike on the U.S.

^ How to ensure that as much telecommunication infrastructure as possible could survive an attack, enabling the U.S. to respond?

----

![fit](http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/www/external/images/baran_central.gif)

^ A centralized network has one single hub

^ The problem is that if the hub was destroyed, the entire network was destroyed

----

![fit](http://www.ibiblio.org/pioneers/images/centralized.gif)

^ A decentralized network might have multiple hubs

^ But then the destruction of any hub still destroyed an entire subnetwork

----

![fit](http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/www/external/images/baran_distrib.gif)

^ Baran's idea was to design what he called a distributed network

^ No hubs at all

^ Every node is connected to adjoining nodes via multiple paths

^ If one destroyed, always another path available

----

![fit](http://www.cybertelecom.org/images/baran.gif)

----

# [fit] Packet-switching

^ Baran also designed the process by which info could be transmitted using such distributed networks

----

![](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6YbjL7JlEE)

^ Each item of data (document, image) divided up into multiple "packets" and transmitted separately along different paths

^ Reassembled at destination

----

![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Packet_Switching.gif)

^ Efficient: allowed for all paths to be used simultaneously, for multiple messages

^ Could survive destruction of nodes of the network: if a packet encountered an obstacle, it could be routed around it

----

[National Physical Laboratory: The Story of Packet Switching](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT4AaelwvV4)

^ [Before watching first 2:00, explain]

^ Analogy: photocopying one page of the Bible at a time and mailing them to someone else, who uses page numbers to reassemble it

----

# [fit] Namespace

^ Namespace = domain of identifiers

^ Internet uses two of them

----

# [fit] IP (Internet Protocol) address

![](http://techstroke.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/20140218161244.jpg)

----

![](http://what-when-how.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/tmp946_thumb1.jpg)

^ An IP address serves as an identifier for the point of connection of any device to the Internet

^ Laptop, smart phone, smart toaster, etc.

----

![](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--oKzyDLhw--/18ixfgyg8mqn1jpg.jpg)

^ That number is visible to anyone who knows how to look for it

^ It's like wearing a name tag

----

* [What is my IP?](https://www.google.com/search?q=what%20is%20my%20IP%20address)

* [Trace My IP](http://www.tracemyip.org)

^ [Demo both]

----

![fit](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_F72DYBxrKoA/TDNwbTztG3I/AAAAAAAAAtE/z2l_krjKJbw/s1600/what-is-my-ip.png)

^ Because IP encodes the connection point of any device to the internet...

^ ...it therefore encodes information about your location, in relation to telecommunications hardware

^ It's nearly impossible for a normal person to successfully obscure that info

----

![](http://d42i.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/landing/ip-tracking/swithportimpactchart.png)

^ That information can often be narrowed to a specific physical location, especially with a stationary device

----

![](http://cdn.colocationameric1.netdna-cdn.com/picts/blog/ip-lookup-location.jpg)

^ People who make anonymous threats on social media are almost always located using the IP address of the device they used

----

![](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkDD03yeLnU)

^ Here's how you might see that process represented on a show like CSI

----

![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Ipv4_address.svg/800px-Ipv4_address.svg.png)

^ An IP address is a 32-bit number represented in decimal notation for human readability

----

![fit](http://www.ml-ip.com/assets/images/ip-addr-1.gif)

^ The first two or three segments identify the general area of the Internet to which you are connected

^ The last one or two segments identify the host machine(s) connecting you to the internet

^ An IP address on the PSU network: first segments: NE USA, PA; last segment: specific computers on the PSU campus through which your connection is being routed

----

![](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--oKzyDLhw--/18ixfgyg8mqn1jpg.jpg)

^ Now, you don't normally encounter numeric IP addresses unless you look for them

^ Or unless you work as a network admin

----

# [fit] DNS (Domain Name System)

^ You do deal with the next of the two namespaces that enable the Internet to work as it does: the DNS

^ That's a linguistic domain added on top of the domain of numerical IP addresses, to make them easier for humans to read

----

![fit](http://vanilla.co.za/images/dslhelp/linksys/WAG120N/address.gif)

^ You can do this to open a Web site

^ Direct address of the computer that hosts a particular web site

^ [nslookup or ping psu.edu, take IP address, put in browser bar]

^ But you don't want to have to do that

^ ?(What do you usually do)

^ What you do instead is you type in a domain name

^ [Type psu.edu]

^ [Ask them for another]

----

# [fit] 93.184.216.119
# [fit] www.example.com

^ The point of this is to allow humans to use easily memorized bits of human language, instead of numbers

----

![fit](http://www.windowsnetworking.com/j_helmig/gifs/tcpipdns.gif)

^ Something or someone has to translate the human language you type into the browser bar... into numerical IP addresses

^ That's called a DNS server

^ A computer on the Internet whose job is to translate human language into numerical addresses

^ [Parse diagram]

^ Like a phone book/ contact directory: you submit a name, get a contact number and/or address in response

----

# [fit] Domain name syntax

^ Domain names have a syntax, just like any other unit of human language, like a sentence

----

^ Part you might be most familiar with

^ Top-level domain
