# [fit] Relation

^ Regardless of complexity, focus is on relation

^ Not on objects in isolation from one another

----

^ Graph is something like a family, insofar as...

^ Often self, as object, is defined in terms of relation to other

^ Family role only has meaning in relation to other roles

# Network

^ Our contemporary concept of network is extrapolated from the concept of the graph

----

^ Like most graphs of data, a network is theoretically infinite

^ A space defined not by its boundaries, but by relation, connection among elements

# Homer, *Iliad* book 18, ca. 1240-1260 BC

> Like the beacons that one by one flare out at sunset from an island besieged by an enemy, its city cloaked all day by smoke rising to high heaven, for whose safety men fought from the battlements all day in bitter conflict; like those beacons, whose light shines out on high for all their neighbours to see, in hopes they might send their ships to the rescue...

^ Use of smoke and fire signals in preclassical Greece

# Aeschylus, *Agamemnon*, ca. 458 BC

I’m still looking for that signal flare,
the fiery blaze from Troy, announcing
it’s been taken. These are my instructions
from the queen.

^ Opening of play, in Argos

^ Watchman ordered by Clytemnestra to watch for a fire signal sent by her husband Agamemnon to mark the conquest of Troy

^ System of mountaintop beacons

^ Then telephone systems beginning in the 1870s

^ Followed railroad construction

----

^ A lot of the cables snapped and pulled down poles with them

^ After that, NYC buried its telecommunications infrastructure underground

----

^ Telegraph cables were eventually run under the Atlantic Ocean too

^ And other major bodies of water

^ A central hub where network operators routed and connected calls to each other
