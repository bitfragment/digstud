ANGEL assessments are graded automatically, and the results should appear in the Gradebook right away. The lowest grade of the eight grades is dropped.

During the second part of the semester, I will enter a grade for you each week to evaluate your participation in the composition of our final working paper. The lowest grade of the six grades is dropped.
