* Vidgames are even more constrained than sport-type games like table tennis
* Table tennis: you can play with different types of equipment, different styles, and players can agree on different rules
* Humans playing with each other can be flexible & adaptable

* Version for Atari 2600 home console, 1980
* Historical beginning of modern global video game industry
* Unlike Pong, Breakout, no analog in real life: a fictional scenario
* You have only two courses of action: move, shoot
* Can't decide to negotiate, or surrender, run away
* Can't be a peacenik: when you decide to play, you decide to kill

## [fit] Domain: Network

^
* Two different kinds of domain, virtual space
* Important difference as forms of representation

----

![fit](http://dev2.opte.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/home-page-pic.png)

^
* Especially when we get to representations of the internet
* Network is not represented from any one person's point of view
* Game requires a player & the player's avatar

----

![fit](http://alt.org/nethack/mirror/www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Portal/2416/display.gif)

^
* A game is designed using an algorithm
* It contains an implicit map of possibilities
* Space through which a player can navigate
* Actions a player can take

----

![fit](http://dev2.opte.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/home-page-pic.png)

^

* Though map overlay usually possible

^
* One game per year from 1992 to 2012
* Things to notice:
    * [Meanwhile narrate year and game title]
    * General increase in graphical detail and speed (hardware advances)
    * Construction of objects: polygons (3D)
    * Outdoor landscapes rather than only interiors
    * Vertical navigation: moving up and down in space
    * Expansion of navigable space for player ("rails" vs. roaming)
