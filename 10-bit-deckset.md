## "Digital paradigm" (Ceruzzi)

**Binary representation** of data:

> …the notion of coding information, computation, and control in binary form, that is, a number system that uses only two symbols, 1 and 0, instead of the more familiar decimal system that human beings, with their ten fingers, have used for millennia

----

## "Digital paradigm" (Ceruzzi)

**Binary logic** of control flow:

> It is not just the use of binary arithmetic, but also the use of binary logic to control machinery and encode instructions for devices, and of binary codes to transmit information

In modern computer systems, the individual characters of the scripts that humans use to record and transmit their languages are encoded in the form of binary numerical codes, just as are the Arabic numerals used in calculation programs.

Wittern, "Character Encoding"

> As long as the processing of information from end to end occurs only in a single machine, there is no need for a standardized character encoding. Early computers up to the beginning of the 1960s thus simply used whatever ad-hoc convention to represent characters internally seemed appropriate; some distinguished upper- and lowercase letters, most did not.

^
* Now, you might wonder how different kinds of early computers could exchange textual data the way we do today
* And the answer is that at first, they didn't
* At first, each computer was used by itself
* So each manufacturer ended up developing its own character encoding conventions

----

![fit](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/ASCII_Code_Chart-Quick_ref_card.png)

^
* That became a problem once computers were networked and needed to exchange data
* If the letter "A" is represented differently by different computers, they can't communicate
* US ASCII was not only an encoding, it was a *standardized* encoding intended for common implementation
* "American Standard Code for Information Interchange": US English only, 1960
* 2014: Unicode
