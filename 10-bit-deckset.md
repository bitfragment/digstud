* Material on "bit" may be most unfamilar to you and most technical
* Thus most difficult to understand — bear with me!
* Later topics -> more familiar
* Those later "genres" are all built on this one, so we need to cover this most fundamental aspect of digital representation

* English "digital" derived from classical Latin "digitalis"
* Unit of measurement: a finger's breadth
* In post-classical Latin: more generally "relating to the finger"

* Tension or paradox from the start:
	* We tend to think of the digital as that which leaves the material behind
	* Including organic material of the body
	* Digital labor, knowledge work as the opposite of "working with your hands" and "getting your hands dirty"
	* But word "digital" originally denoted a part of the body & the hand

* First historical meaning in English (15C) given by OED: whole numbers from 0-9
* What we now call "decimal" or "base 10" numeration
* Historical origin of which might be in counting on our fingers
* Only in the 1970s did "digital" begin to be used to describe electronics

* A paradox here too
* (This image will make sense to you later)
* Even though the word "digital" has a historical meaning linked to decimal numeration…
* …today we associate the digital with a very different counting or enumeration system: binary, or base 2 numeration

## "Digital paradigm" (Ceruzzi)

**Binary representation** of data:

> …the notion of coding information, computation, and control in binary form, that is, a number system that uses only two symbols, 1 and 0, instead of the more familiar decimal system that human beings, with their ten fingers, have used for millennia

----

## "Digital paradigm" (Ceruzzi)

**Binary logic** of control flow:

> It is not just the use of binary arithmetic, but also the use of binary logic to control machinery and encode instructions for devices, and of binary codes to transmit information

* First digital "genre": the bit
* Fundamental unit of representation in a digital medium
* Portmanteau word: bit <- "binary digit"
* "Binary" here refers to base 2 enumeration
* Only two values, 0 and 1
* Larger numbers are represented by sequences of choices between 0 and 1

^
* Binary numbers are sequences of bits
* They are read from right to left, instead of left to right
* Each bit in a binary number is set to either 0 or 1
* Each bit is thus either "on" or "off" — that's it

----

^
* Each bit, reading from right to left, represents a power of 2 *when it is "on"
* 2^0 (1), 2^1 (2), 2^2 (4), 2^3 (8)...
* The first bit has the value of 1 if it is "on," of 0 if it is off
* The second bit has the value of 2 if it is "on," of 0 if it is off
* The third bit has the value of 4 if it is "on," of 0 if it is off

* Now, if it makes you unhappy to think about all this, that's OK
* I understand completely!
* As I've said, in this class we're not going to study the mathematical history of computing, but rather its *linguistic* history
* You have no need to be able to count in binary — something that human beings never do anyway!
