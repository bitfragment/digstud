## Readings

{% bibliography --file 12-domain-3-network %}



## Graph

* A mathematical representation of objects and links, which models *relation*
* L. *graphicus* < *γραϕικός* < *γραϕή*, drawing or writing
* When you draw or write, you are linking points in space
* Any two points can be connected



## Abstract concept of network

* A concept of space defined not by boundaries as much as by *relations*
* Generic elements of a network are often called *nodes*, especially in telecommunications and computing
* Often does not have an *obvious* single center, though it will almost always include *clusters*

* "Networking": an adaptation to describe a social process ([example](http://www.atariarchives.org/deli/computer_networking1.jpg))



## Networked computing

* A *network* includes any two or more individual computer systems connected by a telecommunications link
* The telecommunications link may be a "tube" (hardware wire or cable), or a radio wave (transmitted and received by other hardware components)
* When the two or more systems occupy the same relatively local space (for example, a company office or a college campus), we call the network a Local Area Network (LAN)
* When the two or more systems are located on separate Local Area Networks, they may be linked by the Internet, a "ubiquitous" network-of-networks



## Prehistory of today's *ubiquitous* networked computing

* Telecommunication: τῆλε afar, far off, distant
* Communication at a distance

* Optical telegraphy or semaphore
* Smoke signals and fire beacons
    - Homer, *Iliad* book 18, ca. 1240-1260 BC: "Like the beacons that one by one flare out at sunset from an island besieged by an enemy, its city cloaked all day by smoke rising to high heaven, for whose safety men fought from the battlements all day in bitter conflict; like those beacons, whose light shines out on high for all their neighbours to see, in hopes they might send their ships to the rescue..."
    - Aeschylus, *Agamemnon*, ca. 458 BC: "I’m still looking for that signal flare, the fiery blaze from Troy, announcing it’s been taken. These are my instructions from the queen."
* Buildings: spotter huts, lighthouses
* Claude Chappe's semaphore, France, 1790s
    - Military communication system for French army and government
    - Towers topped with bar structures that could be seen from a distance
    - Could be arranged in various shapes to transmit messages

* Semaphore replaced by telegraph systems beginning in the 1830s
* Then by telephone systems beginning in the 1870s
* Followed railroad construction
* Infrastructure buried underground in cities like New York, after the 1888 blizzard
* Cables run under the Atlantic Ocean, then other major bodies of water

* ARPANET, predecessor of Internet was built over and around telephone infrastructure, starting in the late 1960s

* Earliest form of remote (non-LAN) desktop PC networking: via telephone lines, using an [acoustic coupler modem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_coupler)



## Representations of networked computing

* Focus is not on individual nodes, but on *relations* between nodes
    - [Example](http://cdn3.computerworlduk.com/cmsdata/news/3246271/networking_iStock_000007517489Small.jpg)
    - [Example](http://www.12ahead.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_top_image/public/network.computer.300.fotolia.jpg?itok=t8ZFJQDx)

* Often represented as "overlay" on geographic space
    - [Example](http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/worldwide-computer-network-23344093.jpg)
    - [Example](https://sharmainemercado04.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/computer-network-technology.jpg?w=1200)


* Representations of the Internet often include image of globe/planet
    - [Example](http://photo.elsoar.com/wp-content/images/Laptops-and-earth-globe-computer-network.jpg)
    - [Example](http://telecomsolutions4u.co.uk/images/it.jpg)
    - [Example](http://www.freestockphotos.name/wallpaper-original/wallpapers/systems-internet-connectivity-to-download-5722.jpg)
* Sometimes that globe itself is imagined as a network you can plug into
    - [Example](http://www.danpontefract.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/internet2.jpg)
    - [Example](http://www.xpertcomputers.com.au/images/network-consultancy.jpg)

* [The Opte Project](http://dev2.opte.org/)

## Layered domains

* Your user account is a "small" domain, which you log into
* Your user account grants you access to computing resources like processing time and storage space for your files
* It also serves as a portal to a larger domain: a LAN
* And also as a portal to an even larger domain: the Internet
